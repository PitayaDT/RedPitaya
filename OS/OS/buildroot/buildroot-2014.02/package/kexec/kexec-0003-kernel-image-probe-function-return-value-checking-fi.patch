Subject: [PATCH] kernel image probe function return value checking fix

Currently kexec will use the kernel image type when probe function return
value >=0. It looks odd, but previously it works. Since commit bf06cf2095
it does not work anymore.

During my testing for arm zImage, in 2nd kernel the atags pointer and the
machine_id are not valid, I did a lot of debugging in kernel, finally I found
this is caused by a kexec tools bug instead.

Because uImage will be probed before zImage, also the uImage probe return 1
instead of -1 since bf06cf2095, thus kexec will mistakenly think it is uImage.

Fix this issue by regarding it's valid only when probe return 0.
