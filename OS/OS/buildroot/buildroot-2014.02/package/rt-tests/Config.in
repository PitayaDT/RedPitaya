	  Set of utilities for testing the real-time behaviour of a
	  Linux system.

	  All tools are simple C programs with no dependencies, except
	  the hwlatdetect utility, which is a Python script and
	  therefore requires the Python interpreter. It will only be
	  installed if a Python interpreter has been selected in the
	  Buildroot configuration.

	  Note that this package requires a toolchain built with the
	  NPTL implementation of the pthread API (this is always the
	  case with glibc/eglibc toolchains, but may not necessarily
	  be the case with uClibc toolchains, since the thread
	  implementation is configurable).
