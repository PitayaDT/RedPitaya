'monitoradvanced is copied function for monitoring values in FPGA memory

This function will be hacked a lot, and so the copy was made for making the original function clean'

'The only modifications were made on formating the output:
..* the base 16 is standard default output
..* base 10 was added'

'MAKEFILE was configured as well (just the names of .c and .o files were changed)'
